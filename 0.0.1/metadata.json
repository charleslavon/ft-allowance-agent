Given a near account address, a full access key, an optional transfer recipient Near address, a set of tokens, and a USD growth target for the set of tokens,  a non-agent process watches for the portfolioâ€™s growth target to be met, and if satisfied triggers this agent with the token addresses and amounts to be swapped for USDC or USDT",
