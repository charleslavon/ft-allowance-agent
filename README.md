### Minimal AI Agent Demo
Divvy is a portfolio optimizing Defi Agent that capitalizes on market volatility to grow your wealth, by determining which tokens to periodically swap into stablecoins to secure gains without reducing your portfolio below some minimum USD value. Realize these gains for yourself, or setup a conditional recurring allowance for your crypto curious friends & family.

Our submissions aim to be strong candidates for these tracks - Proximity: $25K Prize Pool (via autonomous use of near-intents), Bitte $5K Prize Pool for our use of chain abstraction, and the General Track DeFi Agents ($20,000 for 5 best teams) As described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vRSABmFAgrpsEquisKOZcF6ZR9ydzdjY03sFbyleu18/edit?tab=t.0).

1. The Agent is deployed to Near.ai, this chat based UI can be used all the flows which require user interaction to setup an allowance goal, then off-chain components monitor a goal's growth conditions and if satisified triggers a notification be sent to the user so they can approve the corresponding deposit/swap/withdraw.

1. Hard Requirements for Qualification. A video overview of the agent-building transactions is required. The agent must be hosted to enable testing by the judges. Additionally, the agent must be open source.

1. Introduction text to describe what the agent can do for its target audience of crypto-native holders of chain-signature supported tokens: "I can help you set a recurring cash-out into stablecoins based off the potential growth in your tokens. Shall we get started?"

1. [AI prompt users for the info needed for whatever auth solution we land on] e.g. Explain that the agent does not have autonomous access to your account, rather you will be prompted to approve swap transactions when an allowance goal's growth targets are trigggered.

1. The agent fetches and displays a count of the NEAR, and omni-ETH tokens on a user's account, along with each token's current price, and the current combined USD value of all of these tokens (this can be considered the total minimum portfolio value, growth can be calculated as a difference from this amount.)

1. The agent prompts the user to create an allowance goal. "What percentage growth rate are you looking to achieve before diversifying into stablecoins?" "Do you have a preference for USDT or USDC stablecoins?"

1. The agent confirms the input params needed to setup an allowance goal

1. The agent should be able to provide the user with an update on the status of their currently active allowance goals. e.g. a textual representation of the Activity section from the UI design
   <img width="660" alt="Allowance Activity" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/975c0071-7186-4932-8361-81a36dbf31f8" />

1. After showing the above flows and the status of configured allowances, perhaps we cut to showing the nearblocks transctions of when an allowance goal is triggered and executed.  Perhaps it would also be helpful to show any internal logs that we have which show the growth conditional being satisifed and the call to trigger the agent/contract.

## Demo Flow (3 minutes)
1. **Introduction (1 minute, 15 seconds)**
We need to make it clear that we intend our submission for 4 prize tracks: Defi, Proximity Labs for our use of near-intents and cross-chain trading, and Bitte for our use of chain abstraction.

  The protagonist:
    An informercial style video opens in black and white with a dishelved person struggling to carry small plush pillows showing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Near logos, they claim: "I couldn't buy the dip because I had no leverage, everything dipped, my portfolio tanked. How can I help my bags stay pumped??"

  Narrator:
    There's an AI for that - Simply tell Divvy Bot "whenever my portfolio pumps at least 18%, swap 6% into USDT". Divvy Bot will consider the current USD value of all the chain signature support tokens in your wallet as a minimum threshold, and when the market pumps your value to grow by at least 18%, Divvy Bot will select a randomized combination of just enough tokens into your preferred stablecoin to realize 6% growth and prompt you to approve the deposit/swap/withdraw transactions to realize your gains.

  The protagonist:
    Now in a color video, perhaps with a beautiful background, the person confidently hold much larger plush pillows showing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Near logos as they claim " I'll never be broke again. I'll always be able to buy the dip."

  Narrator:
   Never be this guy again

Set and forget it with automated growth based stablecoin swaps, and give yourself a regular stablecoinh allowance throughout volatile markets```

2. **Dig into the details of how everything works. (30 seconds)**
   - From within https://chat.near.ai/agents
   - Clicks on Divvy
   - Divvy shows your portfolio of chainsignature supported tokens
   - Divvy prompts for the info needed to setup an allowance goal
   - Set allowance parameters
     * "Secure profits when portfolio grows 20%"
     * AI explains strategy and confirms understanding
   - Show the notification with a link to approve the allowance deposit/swap/withdraw transactions (how close can we get to making this 'one-click' to approve a batch transaction?)
   - Highlight that the allowance goal will be verified when the user clicks the link to verify that market conditions have not changed to cause the allowance goal to no longer be satisfied.
   - Show the technical overview doc, with a QR code to our repository.

3. Sustainability & Future Features (35 seconds)
  - To sustain our committment to open source, the Divvy Bot applies a fee of 1% of the output token per swap.
  - This revenue will fund future enhancements: a standalone Divvy UI to support users with EVM, Coinbase, and Solana wallets, and what we hope will be part of our unique Intellectual Property, our asset optimization algorithm, which currently takes a randomized approach to determine the ideal quantities of tokens to swap into stablecoins while maintaining a specific ratio of holdings across token types. We will also explore extended this logic to consider SOV from a token's crypto twitter community, a user's comfortable risk level, a user's cost basis to inform selling tokens with the least tax impact, and their preferences of tokens to hold over the long-term.

4. **Wrap-up (10s)**
   - Portfolio dashboard view
   - Disclaimer & Call to action on how to start using Divvy

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Frontend/Near.UI Interface

### 2. Smart Contract - N/A

### 3. AI Integration

### 4. Backend

## Blockers:
- **Q:** Is this a **bitte AI agent** or a **near AI agent**? Which would give us an advantage?
  **A:** **Near.AI**
- **Q:** What role does the **LLM** play in the decision-making and allowance setup?
  **A:** Setup and interface initially
- **Q:** Full access key to a wallet has race conditions. We need to determine if the smart contract holds funds.
  **A:** We've decided to pivot away from the fully autonomous FAK approach, and instead prompt the uses when an allowance goal has been triggered.

## Open Questions:
- **Q:** Where do the allowances get stored and accessed? (growth target, allowance amount, payment frequency)
  **A:** Secure database (not smart contract) to preserve privacy and prevent frontrunning.
- **Q:** Where do the **working variables** (e.g., last payment date & amount) get stored?
  **A:** Research **Bitte** options for storage.
- **Q:** If we are doing smart contract escrow, what's executing the trade?
  **A:** Research spike
- **Q:** Stretch goal - Staking integration/optimization, potentially with Nuffle Labs?
  **A:** Not to be prioritized for now.

## Key Decisions:
- **Q:** Escrow or FAK?
  **A:** Research spike needed.
- **Q:** Bitte or NEAR.ai?
  **A:** **Near.ai**.
- **Q:** Where does the UX live?
  **A:** Initially on **Near.ai**.

## Research Spikes:
### 1. **Escrow/LAK/FAK Options**
  - What are the tradeoffs here?

### 2. **Cron Job Feasibility**
  - Can we execute trades in the background with cron?
  - What would be executing the trades?
  - May need results from the Escrow/LAK/FAK spike to proceed.

### 3. **NEAR Intents:**
  - How do we retrieve **user crypto balances**?
  - How do we fetch **current prices**?
  - How to execute **swaps**, handling slippage and fees?
  - Which **assets** can we support?
  - How to manage the access key with intents?

### 4. **Allowance storage:**
  - How can we store allowance?
      - Does Bitte have storage options?
      - What about Neon?
